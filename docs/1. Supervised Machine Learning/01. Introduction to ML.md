# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Course Overview

In this class, you learn about the state of the art and also practice implementing machine learning algorithms yourself. You learn about the most important machine learning algorithms, some of which are exactly what's being used in large AI or large tech companies today. Beyond learning the algorithms though, in this class, you also learn all the important practical tips and tricks for making them perform well.

Why is machine learning so widely used today? Machine Learning had grown up as a sub-field of AI or artificial intelligence. We wanted to build intelligent machines. It turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from a to b, like in your GPS. But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays or build a self-driving car. The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself.

## What is Machine Learning?

Here's a definition of what is machine learning that is attributed to Arthur Samuel.

> He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

He wrote the checkers playing program. And the amazing thing about this program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was he had programmed the computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself and by watching what sorts of board positions tended to lead to wins and what positions tended to lead to losses. The checkers playing program learned over time what a good or bad board positions. By trying to get to good and avoid bad positions, his program learned to get better and better at playing checkers. Because the computer had the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself, it was able to get so much checkers playing experience that eventually it became a better checkers player than Arthur Samuel himself.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

There're many learning algorithms, but the two main types of machine learning are:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithm is the type of machine learning that is used most in meany real world applications, and has seen the most rapid advancement and innovation.

In this course, we focus mostly on supervised learning (for two chapter) and the last chapter is about unsupervised learning. It's also worthy to mention that giving practical advice for applying machine learning algorithms is a very important part of this course. Making sure that you have the right tools and you know how to apply the tools of machine learning effectively as well is our goal. I hope you finish this class as one of those very rare people in the today's world that know how to design and build serious machine learning systems.

#### Supervised Learning

Maybe 99% of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning which is called supervide learning.

In this type of algorithm, we have a set of inputs with correct answers. Give these inputs (X) and output labels (Y), the algorithm learns from given right answers to predict the right answer for new inputs.

There're many real world example of supervides learning as mentioned in below table. For example, by giving a set of emails and their labels (spam or not spam), the algorithm learns to predict whether a new email is spam or not.

Input | Output | Application
---   |---     |---
email | spam? (0/1) | spam filter
audio | text transcript | speech recognition
English | Spanish | machine translation
ad, user info | click? (0/1) | ad click prediction
house size | price | real estate price prediction

Two major types of supervised learning are:

1. Regression means predicting a continuous value (a number out of infinity many possible numbers), such as predicting the price of a house based on its size.

2. Classification means predicting a discrete value (a number out of a small finite set of possible numbers, not between numbers like 1.7), such as predicting whether an email is spam (1) or (0) not spam. The classification task is further divided into binary classification (spam or not spam) and multi-class classification (predicting cat, dog, or bird from an image).

In many real world applications, there are more than one input. For example, in the cancer detection example, we could have more than one input, such as the size of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the number of blood vessels that the tumor is touching.

But how a machine learning algorithm could learn to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant? The answer is that machine learning algorithm learns to find some boundary that separates out the malignant tumors from the benign ones.

#### Unsupervised Learning

After supervised learning, the next most important type of machine learning is unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, we don't have any labels. We just have a bunch of inputs. Say you're given data on patients and their tumor size and patient's age but not whether the tumor was benign or malignant. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find some structure, or some pattern or just something intresting in the unlabeled data.

We call it unsupervised learning because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm to give some quote right answer for every input. We're asking algorithm to find by yourself some structure or pattern in the data.

Data colud be assigned to two (or more) different group or clusters. For example, in the below figure, the data is assigned to two different clusters. The algorithm is trying to find some pattern in the data. This is a particular type of unsupervised learning called clustering algorithm.

As another example, consider Google news. Google news uses unsupervised learning to group news articles into different categories. For example, it might group all the articles about the economy into one cluster, all the articles about sports into another cluster, and all the articles about politics into another cluster. In below figure, the algorithm is clustering news related to pandas into one cluster and all the articles with the keywords of "panda", "twin", "zoo" come together in pattern.

Clusing is a type of unsupervised learning. But there are other types of unsupervised learning as well:

* Anomaly detection: Detecting unusual data points that don't fit well with the rest of the data. For example, detecting credit card fraud in a large set of transactions.

* Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of input features or compress data using fewer numbers. For example, reducing the number of pixels in an image while preserving the most important features.

May these types of unsupervised learning make too much sense to you yet. But don't worry. We'll get to them in this course.
